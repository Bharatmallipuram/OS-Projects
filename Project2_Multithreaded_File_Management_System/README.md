# Multithreaded File Management System

## Overview

This project implements a multithreaded file management system in Python that allows users to perform various file operations concurrently. The system ensures data integrity and prevents race conditions through the use of synchronization mechanisms. Key features include concurrent file reading, exclusive file writing, file deletion, renaming, copying, and metadata display.

## Features

- **Concurrent File Reading**: Multiple threads can read from the same file simultaneously.
- **Exclusive File Writing**: Ensures that only one thread can write to a file at a time.
- **File Deletion**: Allows users to delete files using dedicated threads.
- **File Renaming**: Implements functionality to rename files safely.
- **File Copying**: Enables copying of files with thread management.
- **File Metadata Display**: Shows details like file size, creation date, and permissions.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for all file operations.
- **Logging Operations**: Logs actions performed on files for auditing.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Threading module for concurrency
- Standard file handling libraries

## File Structure

file_management_system/ │ ├── file_manager.py # Main file management logic ├── file_operations.py # Implementation of various file operations ├── logger.py # Logging operations ├── README.md # Project documentation └── requirements.txt

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/file_management_system.git
   cd file_management_system
   ```

## Usage

- **1.Run the program:**
  ```bash
  python file_manager.py
  ```
  The program will perform a series of file operations, including writing to a file, reading from it, renaming it, copying it, and deleting files. You can modify the perform_operations function in file_manager.py to customize the operations performed.

## Logging

All file operations are logged in file_operations.log. This log file contains timestamps and details of each operation performed.

## Error Handling

The program includes robust error handling to manage issues such as file not found, permission errors, and other exceptions that may arise during file operations.
